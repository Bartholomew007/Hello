### Hello Everyone

Some difficulties that I am currently experiencing is keeping tabs with the syntax of Ruby and learning to memorize the language.
Hopefully, with enough practice, I will be able to remember the different functions, calls, etc. within Ruby and implement
them in assignments. 

Hopefully, as time passes, I will be able to learn how to code in Ruby and be able to make websites or other software related to Ruby. 
This opens up an entirely new can of worms that I can get to experience and work with as I plan for my future.
